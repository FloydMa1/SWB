# Star Wars Battlefront Vertical slice

Star wars battlefront is a multiplayer shooting game you can win by completing objectives and survive as a team.
In this project we tried to recreate the star wars battlefront only for a small bit of the game.

## Features

- [UI](https://github.com/FloydMa1/SWB/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/UI)

## Software Anaylse 
The software i was using was Unity Engine to make this project,
we did our best with the time we had becouse a triple A game is hard to recreate with this engine so we were 
carefull of what we did with the engine.

## Learning goals 
What i wanted to learn making this project
- Making 10 seconds of the star wars game
